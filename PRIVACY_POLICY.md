## Information We Collect

The information we collect depends on your role and how you use ICUConnect.

### 1. Information You Provide

**Account Registration:**  
To use ICUConnect, hospital personnel and administrators must create an account. During registration, we collect your name, email address, hospital affiliation, and a password (which is securely hashed). Hospitals provide facility information, including name, location, and contact details.

**Profile and Settings:**  
You may provide additional information, such as your role (doctor, nurse, admin), and customize your notification preferences (e.g., email alerts, in-app notifications, sound/vibration settings).

**Communications:**  
If you contact us for support or feedback, we collect the information you provide, including your contact details and the content of your message.

### 2. Information We Collect Automatically

**Usage and Log Data:**  
We collect information about your activity on ICUConnect, such as login times, actions performed (e.g., updating bed status, making referrals), and system settings. This helps us improve the platform and ensure security.

**Device and Connection Information:**  
We collect technical information such as your IP address, browser type, device information, and operating system to optimize your experience and protect against unauthorized access.

**Notifications and Alerts:**  
We log when notifications are sent and received, and your preferences for receiving them (e.g., email, in-app, sound).

### 3. Information from Third Parties

**Hospital Registry Data:**  
Hospital facility information is sourced from the Kenya Master Health Facility Registry, the official registry of health facilities in Kenya.

**Simulated Data:**  
Some ICU bed capacity and occupancy data may be simulated for research and demonstration purposes.

### 4. Indirect Collection of Patient Data

ICUConnect does not collect patient data directly from patients. Instead, patient information is entered into the system by authorized hospital personnel as part of routine hospital operations. This includes data related to patient admissions, discharges, referrals, and transfers. The information collected may include, but is not limited to:

- Admission and discharge dates
- Referral and transfer details
- ICU bed assignment and occupancy status
- Pseudonymized or coded patient identifiers (where possible)

This data is used solely for the purposes of coordinating ICU resources, managing patient flow, and supporting hospital operations. Where possible, patient data is pseudonymized to protect privacy and is only accessible to authorized users within the healthcare network.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

- Operate and maintain the ICUConnect platform
- Authenticate users and manage access based on roles (hospital, admin, personnel)
- Coordinate ICU bed availability, admissions, discharges, referrals, and transfers
- Provide real-time notifications and alerts about ICU status and patient events
- Generate and display ICU occupancy predictions using machine learning
- Customize your experience based on your settings and preferences

**For Patient Data:**  
Patient information entered by hospital personnel is used exclusively to coordinate ICU bed availability, manage patient flow, and support hospital operations. This data is accessible only to authorized users within the healthcare network and is not shared with third parties except as required by law or for aggregated, anonymized research and reporting.

## How ICUConnect Works for Different Users

### Hospitals

Hospitals are registered entities on ICUConnect. Each hospital has a profile containing facility information and ICU bed capacity. Hospital administrators manage the hospitalâ€™s account, approve personnel, and oversee data accuracy. Hospitals can view and update their ICU bed status, receive and respond to patient referrals, and access analytics.

### Administrators

Administrators have elevated privileges to manage hospital accounts, approve or remove users, and oversee system usage. They can view audit logs, manage notification settings for the hospital, and ensure compliance with policies.

### Hospital Personnel (Users)

Doctors, nurses, and other staff use ICUConnect to admit and discharge patients, initiate and respond to referrals, and update ICU bed status. Users can customize their notification preferences, view real-time updates, and access dashboards relevant to their role.

## Notifications and Settings

ICUConnect provides a range of notification options to keep you informed:

- **In-app notifications:** Real-time alerts for admissions, discharges, referrals, and bed status changes.
- **Email notifications:** Important updates and escalation alerts sent to your registered email.
- **Customizable settings:** You can adjust your notification preferences, including enabling/disabling sound or vibration, setting notification thresholds, and choosing which events trigger alerts.

All notification preferences can be managed in your account settings. Some notifications are mandatory for system security and compliance.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

- **With Other Users:** Information such as hospital name, bed availability, and referral status is shared with authorized users within the healthcare network to coordinate care.
- **With Administrators:** Admins have access to audit logs and system usage data for compliance and security.
- **With Third Parties:** We do not sell or rent your information. Data may be shared with regulatory authorities if required by law. Aggregated, anonymized data may be used for research and reporting.
