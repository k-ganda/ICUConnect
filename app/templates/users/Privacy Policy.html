	<h1>ICUConnect Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p><em>Effective: July 21st, 2021</em></p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		ICUConnect (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is a digital platform designed to help
		public hospitals in Kenya coordinate ICU bed availability, streamline
		patient referrals, and predict ICU occupancy using machine learning
		techniques. We are deeply committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring
		transparency about how we handle your information. This Privacy Policy
		outlines our data practices, including the information we collect, how we
		use it, your choices, and the steps we take to ensure your data remains
		secure and compliant with applicable laws.
	</p>
	<p>
		This policy applies to all users of ICUConnect, including hospitals,
		hospital administrators, and hospital personnel (such as doctors and
		nurses).
	</p>

	<h2>About ICUConnect</h2>
	<p>
		ICUConnect is a web-based dashboard that enables authorized hospitals and
		their personnel to:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>View and update ICU bed availability in real time.</li>
		<li>Refer and transfer patients between hospitals.</li>
		<li>Admit and discharge patients.</li>
		<li>Receive notifications and alerts about ICU status.</li>
		<li>Access predictive analytics for ICU occupancy.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The platform is currently designed and intended for research and
		demonstration purposes, with plans for future deployment in a real-world
		setting. Please note that some data, such as ICU bed capacities and
		occupancy, may be simulated for these purposes and should not be used for
		real-world clinical decision-making.
	</p>

	<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
	<p>
		The information we collect depends on your role and how you interact with
		ICUConnect.
	</p>

	<h3>1. Information You Provide</h3>
	<h4>Account Registration</h4>
	<p>
		To use ICUConnect, hospital personnel and administrators must create an
		account. During registration, we collect your name, email address, hospital
		affiliation, and a password (securely hashed). Hospitals provide facility
		information, including name, location (latitude and longitude), the levels
		(level 1 to 6 according to the Kenyan health system classification), and a
		timezone.
	</p>
	<h4>Profile and Settings</h4>
	<p>
		You may provide additional information, such as your specific role (doctor,
		nurse, admin), and customize your notification preferences (sound settings,
		referral delay time, and in-app notifications).
	</p>
	<h4>Communications</h4>
	<p>
		If you contact us for support, feedback, or inquiries, we collect the
		information you provide, including your contact details and the content of
		your message, to personalize our assistance and address your needs
		effectively.
	</p>

	<h3>2. Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
	<h4>Usage and Log Data</h4>
	<p>
		We automatically collect information about your activity on ICUConnect, such
		as login, verification times, actions performed (e.g., updating bed status,
		initiating or responding to referrals), and system settings. This data helps
		us improve the platform’s functionality, monitor performance, detect
		potential security threats, and maintain a detailed audit trail in line with
		privacy best practices and the Kenya Digital Act, 2019.
	</p>
	<h4>Notifications and Alerts</h4>
	<p>
		We log when notifications are sent and received, and any user interactions
		with these notifications, as well as your preferences for receiving them.
	</p>

	<h3>3. Information from Third Parties</h3>
	<h4>Hospital Registry Data</h4>
	<p>
		Hospital facility information is sourced from the Kenya Master Health
		Facility Registry (KMHFR), the official national registry of health
		facilities in Kenya.
	</p>
	<h4>Simulated Data</h4>
	<p>
		As mentioned, some ICU bed capacity and occupancy data may be simulated for
		research and demonstration purposes during the platform's development and
		testing phases.
	</p>

	<h3>4. Indirect Collection of Patient Data</h3>
	<p>
		ICUConnect does not collect patient data directly from patients. Instead,
		patient information, which is categorized as sensitive personal data under
		Kenyan law, is entered into the system by authorized hospital personnel as
		part of routine hospital operations. This includes data related to patient
		admissions, discharges, referrals, and transfers. The information collected
		may include, but is not limited to:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Admission and discharge dates</li>
		<li>
			Referrals and transfer details (e.g., referring hospital, receiving
			hospital, reason for transfer)
		</li>
		<li>
			Patient demographic details such as name (masked on visualization), age
			and gender
		</li>
		<li>ICU bed assignment and occupancy status</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Responsibility for Patient Consent</h4>
	<p>
		The <strong>hospital</strong>, as the primary data controller, is
		responsible for obtaining appropriate and informed consent from patients for
		the collection and processing of their health data for the purposes of
		coordinating ICU resources, managing patient flow, and supporting hospital
		operations, as required by the Kenya Data Protection Act, 2019, and the
		Digital Health Act, 2023. ICUConnect acts as a data processor (or joint
		controller, depending on the specific agreement with the hospital) on behalf
		of the hospitals, facilitating the lawful processing of this data.
	</p>
	<p>
		This patient data is solely used to coordinate ICU resources, manage patient
		flow, and support hospital operations. On visualization within the platform,
		patient names are masked to protect privacy. Any patient-related data is
		strictly accessible only to authorized users within the specific hospital
		network involved in the patient's care and is not shared with third parties,
		except as required by law or for aggregated, anonymized research and
		reporting purposes.
	</p>

	<h2>How ICUConnect Works for Different Users</h2>
	<h3>Hospitals</h3>
	<p>
		Hospitals are registered entities on ICUConnect, each with a profile
		containing facility information and ICU bed capacity. Each hospital
		designates administrators and users (hospital personnel) responsible for
		operations within that facility.
	</p>
	<h3>Administrators</h3>
	<p>
		Hospital administrators have elevated privileges to manage their hospital
		accounts, approve new users, manage bed counts, and assign other
		administrators within their facility. The specific allocation of
		administrative roles depends on each hospital's internal rules and
		workflows. Administrators can also view audit logs to ensure compliance with
		internal and external policies.
	</p>
	<h3>Hospital Personnel (Users)</h3>
	<p>
		Doctors, nurses, and other authorized staff use ICUConnect to admit and
		discharge patients, initiate and respond to referrals, and update ICU bed
		status. Users can customize their notification preferences, view real-time
		updates, and access dashboards relevant to their specific roles.
	</p>

	<h2>Notifications and Settings</h2>
	<p>
		ICUConnect provides a range of notification options to keep you informed:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>In-app Notifications:</strong> Real-time alerts for admissions,
			discharges, referrals, and escalation alerts for unresponded referrals.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Email Notifications:</strong> Updates such as verification links
			after sign-up, notifications when your account has been approved by
			administrators, or when a new user signs up to your hospital and requires
			approval. These are sent to your registered email address.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Customizable settings:</strong> You can adjust your notification
			preferences, including enabling/disabling sound, setting notification
			thresholds, and choosing which events trigger alerts.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		All notification preferences can be managed directly in your account
		settings. Please note that some notifications are mandatory for system
		security, operational functionality, and compliance purposes.
	</p>

	<h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
	<h3>
		With Other Users Authorized Users within the ICUConnect Healthcare Network
	</h3>
	<p>
